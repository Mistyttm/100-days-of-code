# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and I've begun the basic CSS. 

**Thoughts**: I've been programming on and off for a few years, I'm just doing this as a refresher and to build my skills up stronger

### Day 2: October 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the basic CSS section of the responsive web design course.

**Thoughts**: I knew a bit of this already, but I learned how hexadecimal is worked out, as well as learning about the ``!important`` value (this value forces a CSS element to be displayed over any conflicting assignments). I also learned about the different types of measurement values used in css, I've always used percentages and ``px``, but I learned that ``in`` (inches) and ``cm`` (centimeters) are absolute values that display based on the size of the screen, whilst ``em`` and ``rem`` are relative, and change based on the size of the text.

### Day 3: October 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  completed roughly half of the applied visual design section of the responsive web design course

**Thoughts**: My environment was very different for doing today's work, and I was not as productive as I would have liked. I moved a lot slower and didn't really take in the information properly. I still mostly understood the information, but it wasn't as effective as the last two days. This section has so far been more CSS which I am familiar with.

### Day 4: October 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  begun fixing and adding features to a firefox extension

**Thoughts**: I've been working on this extension with my friend Echo for a few months now, it's a basic word replacer called trigger fixer. we made it so that we could help people block out and replace triggering words with more comfortable words :)

The version on the firefox and chrome stores work, but they are lacking some of the more enhancing features I've been working on, as well as them both having a pretty big bug that causes the replacement to loop infinitely in certain circumstances.

What I did today was work on the light mode CSS and try to get the light/dark mode switcher to work. I think I got the light mode CSS looking pretty nice :)
