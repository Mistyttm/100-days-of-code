# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and I've begun the basic CSS. 

**Thoughts** I've been programming on and off for a few years, I'm just doing this as a refresher and to build my skills up stronger

### Day 2: October 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the basic CSS section of the responsive web design course.

**Thoughts** I knew a bit of this already, but I learned how hexadecimal is worked out, as well as learning about the ``!important`` value (this value forces a CSS element to be displayed over any conflicting assignments). I also learned about the different types of measurement values used in css, I've always used percentages and ``px``, but I learned that ``in`` (inches) and ``cm`` (centimeters) are absolute values that display based on the size of the screen, whilst ``em`` and ``rem`` are relative, and change based on the size of the text.
