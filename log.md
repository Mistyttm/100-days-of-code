# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and I've begun the basic CSS. 

**Thoughts**: I've been programming on and off for a few years, I'm just doing this as a refresher and to build my skills up stronger

### Day 2: October 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the basic CSS section of the responsive web design course.

**Thoughts**: I knew a bit of this already, but I learned how hexadecimal is worked out, as well as learning about the ``!important`` value (this value forces a CSS element to be displayed over any conflicting assignments). I also learned about the different types of measurement values used in css, I've always used percentages and ``px``, but I learned that ``in`` (inches) and ``cm`` (centimeters) are absolute values that display based on the size of the screen, whilst ``em`` and ``rem`` are relative, and change based on the size of the text.

### Day 3: October 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  completed roughly half of the applied visual design section of the responsive web design course

**Thoughts**: My environment was very different for doing today's work, and I was not as productive as I would have liked. I moved a lot slower and didn't really take in the information properly. I still mostly understood the information, but it wasn't as effective as the last two days. This section has so far been more CSS which I am familiar with.

### Day 4: October 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  begun fixing and adding features to a firefox extension

**Thoughts**: I've been working on this extension with my friend Echo for a few months now, it's a basic word replacer called trigger fixer. we made it so that we could help people block out and replace triggering words with more comfortable words :)

The version on the firefox and chrome stores work, but they are lacking some of the more enhancing features I've been working on, as well as them both having a pretty big bug that causes the replacement to loop infinitely in certain circumstances.

What I did today was work on the light mode CSS and try to get the light/dark mode switcher to work. I think I got the light mode CSS looking pretty nice :)

### Day 6: October 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Studied CSS animation in the responsive web design course. 

**Thoughts**: Today's session was a tiny bit confusing to get my head around. There was a lot of looking at the way elements interact with one another. I think in time I'll get my head atound it, but right now I'm pretty tired. Anyway, what I learned was the way the ``position`` value of CSS works, as well as learning how to use gradients and the ``@keyframes`` method. I begun to learn about bezier curves as well, but that was right before I stopped my hour. I think tomorrow, I'm gonna have to do a quick refresher on the bezier curve as well as CSS animations in general. I should also probably stop doing these so late at night. I'm really tired.

### Day 7: October 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished CSS animations and moved onto web design accessibility. 

**Thoughts**: Accessibility is incredibly important in todays world. there are millions of people who require things like screen readers or keyboard controls everyday. So as programmers it's our job to make their online lives easier by providing these accesssibility features to our pages and programs. I learnt about a few HTML elemenets that I didn't know about before, for example: ``<legend>``, ``<main>``, ``<audio>`` and ``taborder``. The4se elements work really well in combination to provide disabled users greater access to the internet.

### Day 8: October 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Learnt about ``@media``, CSS flex boxes and started learning about CSS grids. 

**Thoughts**: CSS flex is one of those things I could never really wrap my head around. but now seeing it layed out like this, it's really quite simple. The different values just wrap the specified content around its container. Simple really!

### Day 9: October 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Completed my first full project to make a website. 

**Thoughts**: This was a real challenge to try and remember all the skills I've learnt over the last few days for this simple website. My memory isn't actually all that good tbh, but I did manage to cobble something together that looks pretty alright

### Day 10: October 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the second project. 

**Thoughts**: Today was much easier, if a bit tedious. I've always found creating forms to be super tedious. This task required me to make one. so I did, but then since the hour wasn't up I also decided to do some non-required CSS design which I think look pretty okay for a small amount of time actually doing the CSS.
