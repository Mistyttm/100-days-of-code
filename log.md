# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML and HTML5 exercises on FreeCodeCamp, and I've begun the basic CSS. 

**Thoughts**: I've been programming on and off for a few years, I'm just doing this as a refresher and to build my skills up stronger

### Day 2: October 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I completed the basic CSS section of the responsive web design course.

**Thoughts**: I knew a bit of this already, but I learned how hexadecimal is worked out, as well as learning about the ``!important`` value (this value forces a CSS element to be displayed over any conflicting assignments). I also learned about the different types of measurement values used in css, I've always used percentages and ``px``, but I learned that ``in`` (inches) and ``cm`` (centimeters) are absolute values that display based on the size of the screen, whilst ``em`` and ``rem`` are relative, and change based on the size of the text.

### Day 3: October 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  completed roughly half of the applied visual design section of the responsive web design course

**Thoughts**: My environment was very different for doing today's work, and I was not as productive as I would have liked. I moved a lot slower and didn't really take in the information properly. I still mostly understood the information, but it wasn't as effective as the last two days. This section has so far been more CSS which I am familiar with.

### Day 4: October 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  begun fixing and adding features to a firefox extension

**Thoughts**: I've been working on this extension with my friend Echo for a few months now, it's a basic word replacer called trigger fixer. we made it so that we could help people block out and replace triggering words with more comfortable words :)

The version on the firefox and chrome stores work, but they are lacking some of the more enhancing features I've been working on, as well as them both having a pretty big bug that causes the replacement to loop infinitely in certain circumstances.

What I did today was work on the light mode CSS and try to get the light/dark mode switcher to work. I think I got the light mode CSS looking pretty nice :)

### Day 5: October 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Created a theme switcher for the trigger fixer extension

**Thoughts**: I'm so happy I finally got this feature working! it's been months since it was suggested, and it fully workss!!!!! I'm so happyyyy

### Day 6: October 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Studied CSS animation in the responsive web design course. 

**Thoughts**: Today's session was a tiny bit confusing to get my head around. There was a lot of looking at the way elements interact with one another. I think in time I'll get my head atound it, but right now I'm pretty tired. Anyway, what I learned was the way the ``position`` value of CSS works, as well as learning how to use gradients and the ``@keyframes`` method. I begun to learn about bezier curves as well, but that was right before I stopped my hour. I think tomorrow, I'm gonna have to do a quick refresher on the bezier curve as well as CSS animations in general. I should also probably stop doing these so late at night. I'm really tired.

### Day 7: October 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Finished CSS animations and moved onto web design accessibility. 

**Thoughts**: Accessibility is incredibly important in todays world. there are millions of people who require things like screen readers or keyboard controls everyday. So as programmers it's our job to make their online lives easier by providing these accesssibility features to our pages and programs. I learnt about a few HTML elemenets that I didn't know about before, for example: ``<legend>``, ``<main>``, ``<audio>`` and ``taborder``. The4se elements work really well in combination to provide disabled users greater access to the internet.

### Day 8: October 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Learnt about ``@media``, CSS flex boxes and started learning about CSS grids. 

**Thoughts**: CSS flex is one of those things I could never really wrap my head around. but now seeing it layed out like this, it's really quite simple. The different values just wrap the specified content around its container. Simple really!

### Day 9: October 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Completed my first full project to make a website. 

**Thoughts**: This was a real challenge to try and remember all the skills I've learnt over the last few days for this simple website. My memory isn't actually all that good tbh, but I did manage to cobble something together that looks pretty alright

### Day 10: October 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the second project. 

**Thoughts**: Today was much easier, if a bit tedious. I've always found creating forms to be super tedious. This task required me to make one. so I did, but then since the hour wasn't up I also decided to do some non-required CSS design which I think look pretty okay for a small amount of time actually doing the CSS.

### Day 11: October 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the third project. 

**Thoughts**: Okay, imma be honest, I almost missed today's session. I caught myself in time, but I still *almost* missed it. so that was a bit scary tbh, gotta hold myself accountable for this. Anyway, today's task was to create a landing page. I was mostly successful on the CSS front, there are still quite a few kinks, but it satisfies every single requirement to pass the task, so I'm happy :)

### Day 12: October 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the fourth project. 

**Thoughts**: This one took me a really long time, I was having issues passing the tests. Turns out I wasn't spelling things correctly. What a surprise (/s). and then after that I was having a large amount of issues in just getting the content to sit side by side. That was,,,,,,frustrating, to say the least. Today I'll also provide the actual [pen link](https://codepen.io/mistyttm/pen/QWMvYQL) so you can see what I actually did. It was thoroughly frustrating. When I found out I was misspelling stuff, I yelled out, yeah it wasd a whole thing. But that one is over now, took the longest. Onto whatever tomorrow has in store for me.

### Day 13: October 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the fifth project. 

**Thoughts**: I'm so tired today, I am not happy with this one, at all. I have no other thoughts. But I did finish the responsive design thingie

### Day 14: October 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  Begun JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. 

**Thoughts**: This marks 2 weeks since I began this challenge, I got my first certificate yesterday which was nice. Today I begun learning JS, which is far more 'programmy' than CSS and HTML imo. I did 46 out of the 113 challenges in basic javascript. I reckon I could speed through this one like I did to the responsive web design one too :)

### Day 15: October 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Learnt about functions, comparison and if/else and switch statements. 

**Thoughts**: So today was relatively straight forward. Learnt about how functions with no arguments worked and how functions WITH arguments worked. Also learned about the ``==``, ``===``, ``!=``, ``!==``, ``<``, ``>``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``&&`` and ``||``. that is ``equivalent``, ``strict equivalent``, ``not equal``, ``strict not equal``, ``less than``, ``greater than``, ``less than or equal to``, ``greater than or equal to``, ``and`` and ``or``. All very important values which I then used in learning If/else statements which I then followed with switch/case statements

### Day 16: November 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**:  Learnt about Objects and more complex switch statements. 

**Thoughts**: Hi! I took a mental health break yesterday as you may have noticed (first one of 7 possible owo). But I'm back today :D
Today was all about JS objects and complex switch statements. Objects are very familiar as I've done a bit of work with JSON before. And it's very helpful to know you can group multiple casees for one response value. I'm back on the grind and I won't be taking another break for 2 weeks, maybe even not at all owo

### Day 17: November 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:  Learnt more about JSON and struggled with recurrence and learnt ``for``, ``while`` and ``do...while`` loops. 

**Thoughts**: Today was more JSON functions and also learning about this thing called recurence. The main focus however, was loops, I don't exactly have much more to say about this, although when doing the function challenges, I did seriously struggle to get them to work. Why? I had incorrect capitalisation. that was most infuriating

### Day 18: November 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:  Learnt about a different type of recursion and the ``?`` thingie. 

**Thoughts**: The most interesting thing for me today was learning about the ``a ? b : c`` method. I've always seen that used in places but never understood how it worked. now I do tho~! basically it works exactly like an if/else statement, just shorter: ``a`` is the comparison you want to make ``b`` is the code to be executed and ``c`` is the else :))

### Day 19: November 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:  Started on ES6 

**Thoughts**: I didn't know ES6 was a thing! It's quite interesting some of the things you can do with it. today I mainly learnt about ``Object.freeze()`` and arrow notation. you can check it out in my new [Notes Page](https://github.com/Mistyttm/100-days-of-code/blob/master/notes.md) where I'm gonna start taking notes so that I don't forget what I learn. means I'll get less done but hopefully retain more knowledge.

### Day 20: November 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**:  continued learning ES6 

**Thoughts**: ES6 is honestly really interesting. I had no idea code could be made this compact! like, seriously, the stuff you can do with ES6 makes life sooo much easier. I kinda wish I'd known a lot of this for some of my previous projects. I probably could honestly go back over them and redo them to make them neater and probably more efficient as well.

### Day 21: November 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:  Learnt more about destructuring and about `class` 

**Thoughts**: ES6 really does provide some nice neat and efficient ways to code. it's quite nice. I'm honestly really enjoying learning about JS, I know a lot of programmers shit on it and stuff, but it's really fun learning about it :>

### Day 22: November 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  learnt mainly about promises and import/export keywords

**Thoughts**: Promises are what's used in order to run asynchronous code where you don't know how long it's going to take. this is extremel;y useful for larger programs. Learning about the import/export keywords is also useful for when I need to get functions from different files and import them :>

Also I saw what I'm doing tomorrow....I'm doing regular expressions...I'm dreading that
